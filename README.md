# data-base-virtual-library-
The project revolves around creating a virtual library database on the network. This library  allows users to borrow books from each other and donate them. The library consists of lenders,  borrowers and supervisors. Each person has an account that can create it. The library will be  built using JavaFx and MySQL.
